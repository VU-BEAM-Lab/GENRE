# GEN

## Overview
GEN (GPU Elastic-Net) is a MATLAB package that allows for many instances of linear regression with elastic-net regularization to be performed in parallel on a GPU.

## Setup
In order to utilize GEN, a CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU along with an available release of MATLAB is required. The MATLAB Parallel Computing Toolbox must also be installed if not already installed in order to allow for the compilation of MEX-files containing CUDA code. Moreover, a C/C++ compiler that is compatible with the installed release of MATLAB must be installed in order to compile MEX-files containing C/C++ code. The compiler compatibility can be found at https://www.mathworks.com/support/requirements/supported-compilers.html. Note that the code was evaluated on both Windows and Linux OS. For Windows, the free community edition of Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 was used as the C/C++ compiler. To download this older version, go to https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/, and create a free Dev Essentials program account with Microsoft. When installing Microsoft Visual Studio 2017, make sure to also check the box for the VC++ 2015 toolset (the 2015 will most likely be followed by a version number). For Linux, the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) was used as the C/C++ compiler. In addition to a C/C++ compiler, a CUDA toolkit version that is compatible with the installed release of MATLAB must be installed. To determine compatibility, refer to https://www.mathworks.com/help/parallel-computing/gpu-support-by-release.html. Once the compatibility is determined, go to https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive and install the particular CUDA toolkit version. Note that the installation process for the toolkit will also allow for the option to install a new graphics driver. If you do not desire to install a new driver, then you must ensure that your current driver supports the toolkit version that is being installed. For driver and toolkit compatability, refer to page 4 of https://docs.nvidia.com/pdf/CUDA_Compatibility.pdf.

Once all of the above steps are completed, you should check to see that MATLAB recognizes your GPU card. To do so, go to the command prompt and type gpuDevice the code should be able to be compiled. Go to the MATLAB directory that contains the repository folders, and add them to your MATLAB path. The next step is to type the compilation commands into the MATLAB command prompt. On windows
