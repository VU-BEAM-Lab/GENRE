# GEN

# Overview
GEN (GPU Elastic-Net) is a MATLAB package that allows for many instances of linear regression with elastic-net regularization to be performed in parallel on a GPU.

# Setup
In order to utilize GEN, a CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU along with an available release of MATLAB is required. The MATLAB Parallel Computing Toolbox is also required in order to allow for the compilation of the MEX-files that contain CUDA code.
